# ChitQuest - the chit-iest app

## WHAT ARE THIS?

We all love chits right? Now we can love them no matter where we are.

Collect chits. Defeat big chits. Take no chits. It's all up to you.

## HOW DO I WHAT NOW?

Just tap everything. BUT there is a strategy

If you defeat tasks with the same color, you'll get a streat and multiply your chit power.

Each opponent has TASKS. The more chits you have, the more tasks you can chit.

## LOOTS?

Yep. As you gain chit. You gain power. All the chits are belong to you

## WHY WEASEL WHY YOU DO DIS?

Because it's almost April 1st. And we should have fun things too.

My folks once convinced me as a young boy that my milk - which my eyes told me was green - was in fact normal white milk. I was adament.

That was when I learned of April Fools. And also how perception is everything.

And how you should always question your senses.

## IS THIS GOOD CODE?

Not really. I hacked it together Saturday night after resurrecting an ancient thing I had in the hangar from years ago in an hour or so.

Stop looking at me swan.
